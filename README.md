# Personal Neovim Configuration

This is my old personal Neovim configuration due to it being outdated, I now use NvChad as my personal config! 

This is a collection of customizations, plugins, and key mappings I used for an optimized and efficient coding experience.

Feel free to explore, fork, and adapt this setup to your needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## Features

- **LSP (Language Server Protocol) Setup**: Pre-configured for multiple languages, including Lua, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C, and more.
- **Key Mappings**: Custom key bindings for navigation, code actions, file searching, and LSP functionality.
- **Plugin Setup**: A selection of essential plugins to improve productivity, including:
  - Telescope for fuzzy finding
  - nvim-treesitter for syntax highlighting
  - LSP configuration for auto-completion, diagnostics, and more
  - And many others for improved editing experience
- **Personalized Theme**: Use of a dark theme that is easy on the eyes, along with a custom status line for better context.
